Real-Time Face Recognition System – DEBI AI Competition (3rd Place, Jan 2025)  
• Developed a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV and Haar cascade for face detection. 
• Implemented a KNN-based classification model to recognize team members with high accuracy. 
• Built a training pipeline to extract face embeddings, store labeled data, and train the model. 
• Optimized model performance with improved feature extraction and preprocessing techniques. 
• Successfully deployed the system for live recognition, earning 3rd place in the DEBI AI competition and 
receiving a certificate of achievement.
